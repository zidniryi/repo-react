                To enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to one's family,
                to bring peace to all, one must first discipline and control
                one's own mind. If a man can control his mind he can find the
                way to Enlightenment, and all wisdom and virtue will naturally
                come to him.

                Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing
                economic growth... these are one and the same fight. We must
                connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy
                shortages, global health, food security and women's empowerment.
                Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.

                Our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life
                in which chance has placed us, but is always the result of a
                good conscience, good health, occupation, and freedom in all
                just pursuits.

                Being in control of your life and having realistic expectations
                about your day-to-day challenges are the keys to stress
                management, which is perhaps the most important ingredient to
                living a happy, healthy and rewarding life.
